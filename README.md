# Aurelia Contact List

Following http://aurelia.io/docs/tutorials/creating-a-contact-manager

## Impressions

#### Good

* Less boilerplate than angular 2+, while keeping dependency injection workflow
* Cleaner syntax than angular 2+, web standards

#### Bad

* Feels old-school next to react
* Still fiddly component setup, separate templates means you have to type magic strings against models (+ poor tooling)
* Bad error messages, difficult debugging
