# Aurelia Contact List

Following http://aurelia.io/docs/tutorials/creating-a-contact-manager

## Impressions

#### Good

* Good interop with traditional js libraries (jQuery-based stuff)
* Less boilerplate than angular 2+, while keeping dependency injection workflow
* Cleaner syntax than angular 2+, web standards

#### Bad

* I still feel disincentivized to create components freely, unlike react
* Separate templates means you have to type magic strings against models (poor tooling in editors doesn't help)
* Bad error messages, difficult debugging
* `EventAggregator` sync system feels absolutely archaic compared to the one way data flows from The Big 3.
* Low mind-share, doesn't seem to be going anywhere

#### Conclusion

Aurelia achieves what it wants to be - a conservative-ish web-only 2-way-binding SPA framework in the style of angular 1 and ember from the days of yore. Fair enough, but that's probably not good enough to gain any traction in 2018.

It's the D language of SPA-s. Slightly better version of a more popular counterpart (angular in this case), but not better enough to win the mindshare game.
